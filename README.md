# Clio

`Clio` is a Call for Papers (CFP) harvester and indexer. 

## Description

`Clio` grew out of my desire to collect CFPs for upcoming conferences and publications in various areas of interest, and display all the relevant information in one place in a convenient, readable format.

Clio generates a web page[[1]](#links) which displays current CFPs for those topics. The page is bookmarkable and updated daily, thus saving the hassle of constantly searching for new CFPs.
